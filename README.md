    LaTekonomer strives to provide the Overleaf/LaTex templates that many economists wish someone else would make and maintain.
     <br />
     <br />
    The templates include but are not limited to: professional but simple dark and light Beamer templates; tables (including three-part tables with footnotes); figures; and a number of research exercises.
    <br />
      <br />
    These research exercises come from ECON 412 International Environmental Economics, a course taught at Yale University by Sam Kortum, for which Jillian Stallman has been teaching assistant in Fall 2023 and Fall 2024.
      <br />
      <br />
    Many of these tables and figures are outputs of vignettes and code provided in the R package  <a href="https://github.com/stallman-j/ekonomR"><strong>ekonomR</strong></a>. <strong>ekonomR</strong> and <strong>LaTekonomer</strong>  are designed to be complementary research templates. If you're starting a new project I highly recommend checking out <strong>ekonomR</strong>. Use of LaTekonomer does not require ekonomR or vice versa.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Rather than carrying along a hodgepodge of LaTex files with all those settings that you got just right, or trying to figure out how to ask ChatGPT how to do it all over again, why not have a template that you can use to start off any new project that contains the LaTex syntax for the stuff you tend to use?

The goal of LaTekonomer is to provide, for me, for you, for your students, for your collaborators, a place to store that code that you spent hours searching StackExchange to finally finagle just right. This is where you can find the basic code for a three-part long table that stretched across multiple pages with footnotes at the very end. This is where your students can find 


Have you ever thought, as you looked back through your old Overleaf projects or Dropbox tex files, that it would be really nice if you just had the syntax for all those tables or side-by-side figures or Beamer templates all in one place? Well, now you do!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repository is linked with an Overleaf Project, so there are a few ways you might want to use it on your own machine. I'll go over the steps for each of these.

1. Copying the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpdhvnnjzsxq#7e6598">LaTekonomer Overleaf Template</a>
   - Do this if the following seem to apply to you:
      * You've never used LaTex before (but want to learn) and have never used GitHub before (and don't feel a need to learn just yet) or the word "GitHub" means nothing to you.
      * You use Overleaf but don't keep a local LaTex installation on your computer.
            - Installing LaTex locally can be a pain. If you're not sure how much you'll use LaTex even with all these templates, try the Overleaf route first.
2. Forking the Git Repository
   - <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github" > Forking </a> means that you copy this LaTekonomer Github repository to your own Github repository with a (hopefully) different name, which you then take as the foundation for your own project.
   - Do this if you:
        * Already use Github or
        * Want an excuse to start using Github
   - Why would you want to start using GitHub?
        * GitHub is a standard method for making research code, inputs, and outputs transparent, replicable, and sharable among many fields. Economics is catching up in this trend.
        * If you're just starting a research project, starting it with Github allows you to maintain version control throughout your project without having to do something like Dropbox rewind. Your future self will thank you.
        * If you have any collaborators (or end up getting any collaborators), it'll allow them to join your project fairly easily.
        * You'll save yourself from possibly losing all your code or output if you run into tech problems
   - You can fork and sync either with your own Overleaf or on your local system
4. Downloading the files into your local system
   - You can download either from the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpdhvnnjzsxq#7e6598">LaTekonomer Overleaf Template</a> or from Github.

You may be wondering:
a. What if I want to edit the source files?
   - <a href="#contributing">Become a contributor! </a>
b. What about making other branches with Git?
   - Overleaf says it <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/GitHub_Synchronization" > doesn't play nicely with branching </a>, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61242083/git-push-of-an-overleaf-project-to-a-different-branch-other-than-master">of course people have figured out workarounds.</a> 



### Prerequisites and Installation

Your prerequisites and installation steps will depend on how you're anticipating you'll use these templates. Let's go through the setup from least to most overhead.

<strong> Copying the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpdhvnnjzsxq#7e6598">LaTekonomer Overleaf Template</a> </ strong>

1. You'll need an <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/" > Overleaf account </a>. If you're at a university, your university email might give you access to Overleaf premium, which would allow you to sync with GitHub fairly easily. Try using the SSO option with your university domain if you have that.

2. Once you have your account, log into Overleaf.

3. Click on this <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpdhvnnjzsxq#7e6598" > LaTekonomer share link </a>.https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpdhvnnjzsxq#7e6598

4. Click "Menu" on the top left of the screen with the project showing in Overleaf, and then "Copy Project"

<div class="figure">
<img src="vignette-figs/README/README_overleaf-copy_01.png" alt="copy overleaf project" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">Copy the Overleaf Project</p>
</div>

5. Rename to something like "my-awesome-project." If this is for a class, something like "ECON-412" would be good.

<div class="figure">
<img src="vignette-figs/README/README_overleaf-copy_02.png" alt="rename project" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">Rename your project</p>
</div>

You're set up! Easy as that.
