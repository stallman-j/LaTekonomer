\section{Appendices}

You can reference an appendix just like you can reference a chapter. An easy setup for articles and theses is along the lines of \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/49643/making-appendix-for-thesis}.

You can start an appendices section with \verb+\appendix+, and then just keep writing, but then you can't switch back. You split appendices with the same method you'd used to split up your regular text (e.g. after \verb+\appendix+, if you used \verb+\section{An Appendix}+ it would be numbered like an Appendix, not a regular section.


More sensibly, add package \verb+\usepackage[toc]{appendix}+. Depending on the document class, you'll either use \verb+\chapter{Appendix name}+ or \verb+\section{Appendix name}+ and then you add labels as you would elsewhere. TOC option puts the appendix in the table of contents.You can also add \verb+page+ as an option, which puts it on a new page.

For fuller detail, see \url{http://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-appendix}


\begin{appendices}

%\chapter{Some Appendix} for book or thesis class
The contents...

\section{An Appendix}
La la la


\end{appendices}

You can also use \verb+subappendices+, which makes use of the \verb+subsection+ environment:

\section{Here's a Regular Section}

Now I have some text

\begin{subappendices}

\subsection{Subsection appendix}\label{sec:miniappendix}
This is a Mini Appendix for my section

\end{subappendices}

\section{A New Section}

The miniappendix is Appendix~\ref{sec:miniappendix}
