  abstract = {This paper introduces endogenous and directed technical change in a growth model with environmental constraints. The final good is produced from "dirty" and "clean" inputs. We show that: (i) when inputs are sufficiently substitutable, sustainable growth can be achieved with temporary taxes/subsidies that redirect innovation toward clean inputs; (ii) optimal policy involves both "carbon taxes" and research subsidies, avoiding excessive use of carbon taxes; (iii) delay in intervention is costly, as it later necessitates a longer transition phase with slow growth; and (iv) use of an exhaustible resource in dirty input production helps the switch to clean innovation under laissez-faire.

  abstract = {We introduce firm and worker heterogeneity into a model of innovation-driven endogenous growth. Individuals who differ in ability sort into either a research sector or a manufacturing sector that produces differentiated goods. Each research project generates a new variety of the differentiated product and a random technology for producing it. Technologies differ in complexity and productivity, and technological sophistication is complementary to worker ability. We study the co-determination of growth and income inequality in both the closed and open economy, as well as the spillover effects of policy and conditions in one country to outcomes in others.},

  abstract = {An increasing amount of high-resolution global spatial data are available, and used for various assessments. However, key economic and human development indicators are still mainly provided only at national level, and downscaled by users for gridded spatial analyses. Instead, it would be beneficial to adopt data for sub-national administrative units where available, supplemented by national data where necessary. To this end, we present gap-filled multiannual datasets in gridded form for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI). To provide a consistent product over time and space, the sub-national data were only used indirectly, scaling the reported national value and thus, remaining representative of the official statistics. This resulted in annual gridded datasets for GDP per capita (PPP), total GDP (PPP), and HDI, for the whole world at 5\,arc-min resolution for the 25-year period of 1990\textendash 2015. Additionally, total GDP (PPP) is provided with 30\,arc-sec resolution for three time steps (1990, 2000, 2015).},

  abstract = {To support global-scale assessments that are sensitive to agricultural land use, we developed the global data set of monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000). With a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (about 9.2 km at the equator), MIRCA2000 provides both irrigated and rainfed crop areas of 26 crop classes for each month of the year. The data set covers all major food crops as well as cotton. Other crops are grouped into categories (perennial, annual, and fodder grasses). It represents multicropping systems and maximizes consistency with census-based national and subnational statistics. According to MIRCA2000, 25\% of the global harvested areas are irrigated, with a cropping intensity (including fallow land) of 1.12, as compared to 0.84 for the sum of rainfed and irrigated harvested crops. For the dominant crops (rice (1.7 million km2 harvested area), wheat (2.1 million km2), and maize (1.5 million km2)), roughly 60\%, 30\%, and 20\% of the harvested areas are irrigated, respectively, and half of the citrus, sugar cane, and cotton areas. While wheat and maize are the crops with the largest rainfed harvested areas (1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km2, respectively), rice is clearly the crop with the largest irrigated harvested area (1.0 million km2), followed by wheat (0.7 million km2) and maize (0.3 million km2). Using MIRCA2000, 33\% of global crop production and 44\% of total cereal production were determined to come from irrigated agriculture.},

  abstract = {The Flood-Drought condition over the Three-River Headwater region (TRHR) of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) exerts vital impacts on regional climate and downstream livelihoods. However, the reasons behind precipitation variability over this region remain elusive. In this study, the multi-year moisture sources of water vapour reaching the TRHR were identified to reveal their connection to the interannual variability of summer precipitation by utilizing a Lagrangian diagnosis analysis. The results show that the moisture sources could be tracked backward covering vast areas, with the peak values located mostly at the northern Indian continent and adjacent regions of TRH itself. The variability of integrated moisture sources' contribution agrees well with the summer precipitation on the interannual scale; However, the role of different regions varies in line with their geographical location. More specifically, summer precipitation is positively correlated with the moisture source over the adjacent areas of TRH and the remote terrestrial-oceanic regions, in contrast to a negative correlation to the water vapour departing from the Northeastern Asian and western regions to the TP. The Indian summer monsoon circulation and local recycling process play a dominant role in modulating the summer precipitation on the interannual scale, whereas the role of the westerlies is almost negligible. The abnormal atmosphere circulations triggered by mid-high latitude wave trains and anomalies in SST in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean could serve as possible drivers for the precipitation variability over TRHR.},
