# Overview

If you're interested in doing research projects in the future (like writing a senior thesis), I highly, highly recommend getting started with Overleaf. If you're not planning on writing a senior thesis and don't plan on doing research projects beyond this class, Microsoft Word or Markdown will do just fine.

In Microsoft Word, the `Alt+=` key combination will open up the equation editor. There, you can use shorthand for a lot of equations to write them quickly. It takes a little getting used to but is actually pretty quick. I'm not going to go over the key combinations here, but you can find them with a Google search.

There are a lot of ways you can use Overleaf. In particular, you can sync your Overleaf repository with Github. Come talk to me (Jillian) if you're interested in this possibility. You can also download LaTex onto your machine and use local files. This is usually a pain to install, so let's not go over it for now.

# Copying the LaTekonomer Overleaf Template

1. You'll need an <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/" > Overleaf account </a>.

    If you're at Yale, your university email will give you access to Overleaf premium, which would allow you to sync Overleaf directly to GitHub. If you're unsure which email to use, just use your university email for now. You can port all your stuff out in the future if you prefer using your personal account.

2. Once you have your account, log into Overleaf.

3. Click on this <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/read/wsrdjdckwmbz#f4467b" > share link </a>. You won't be able to edit my Overleaf folders, but you'll be able to see it and copy it into your own Overleaf account. Click `Join Project`.

4. Click "Menu" on the top left of the screen with the project showing in Overleaf, and then "Copy Project"

5. Rename to something like "ECON-412_your-name". This way you'll be able to use this same structure for all your ECON 412 stuff (including your research project). I'll continue adding files into the original template, but I'll include explanations for how to just copy those over into your stuff later on. You might not want to use just "ECON-412" the way I did here, because the most likely scenario if you're using Overleaf is that for your project, someone in your group will make *their* copy of this Overleaf into your group's Overleaf, and share it with all the meembers of your group. You'll all then be able to view and edit these files, a bit like using Google Docs but with a more professional output.

6. This should bring you to your own project page. You'll be able to access this folder any time you access Overleaf. Once you get to the research project stage, I'll show you how to share this project with your groupmates.
