# Overview

If you're interested in doing research projects in the future (like writing a senior thesis), I highly, highly recommend getting started with Overleaf. If you're not planning on writing a senior thesis and don't plan on doing research projects beyond this class, Microsoft Word or Markdown will do just fine.

In Microsoft Word, the `Alt+=` key combination will open up the equation editor. There, you can use shorthand for a lot of equations to write them quickly. It takes a little getting used to but is actually pretty quick. I'm not going to go over the key combinations here, but you can find them with a Google search.

There are a lot of ways you can use Overleaf. In particular, you can sync your Overleaf repository with Github. Come talk to me (Jillian) if you're interested in this possibility. You can also download LaTex onto your machine and use local files. This is usually a pain to install, so let's not go over it for now.

# Feedback

If you're finding anything unclear or unhelpful, let me know in my [ECON 412 Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWYUyhNyq6OfDbsTyurtNOa1xjKZzi5CK36wMbdPHCRPVURQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

It's anonymous unless you want me to respond (in which case you need to tell me who you are).

# Getting Started 

Assuming the reason you're still reading is that you're planning on using overleaf, let's get started.

## Copying the ECON 412 Overleaf Template

1. You'll need an <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/" > Overleaf account </a>.

    Your Yale email will give you access to Overleaf premium, which would allow you to sync Overleaf directly to GitHub. If you're unsure which email to use, just use your university email for now. You can port all your stuff out in the future if you prefer using your personal account.

2. Once you have your account, log into Overleaf.

3. Click on this <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/read/wsrdjdckwmbz#f4467b" > share link </a>. You won't be able to edit my Overleaf folders, but you'll be able to see it and copy it into your own Overleaf account. Click `Join Project`.

    <p class="caption">Join the ECON 412 Overleaf Project </p>
    </div> 


4. Click "Menu" on the top left of the screen with the project showing in Overleaf, and then "Copy Project"
    
    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_02.png" alt="menu button" width="80%" />
    <p class="caption">Menu</p>
    </div> 

    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_03.png" alt="copy overleaf project" width="20%" />
    <p class="caption">Copy the Overleaf Project</p>
    </div> 


5. Rename to something like "ECON-412_your-name". 

    You might not want to use just "ECON-412" the way the following figure shows. If you're using Overleaf for your project, you'll most likely end up using one of your group member's Overleaf projects as your group project and will share it with all the meembers of your group. 

    You'll all then be able to view and edit these files in real time. It's like Google Docs, but so much geekier.

    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_04.png" alt="rename and create" width="40%" />
    <p class="caption">Rename and Create</p>
    </div> 

6. This should bring you to your own project page. You'll be able to access this folder any time you access Overleaf. Click on the pdf `ECON-412_HW-01_guidance.pdf` in that project page for your next steps.

    Once you get to the research project stage, I'll show you how to share this project with your groupmates. I'll update the templates folder as the semester goes on, but I'll include instructions for using that as we go.

# Adding New Files

I'll add this for project assignment 1 once it's up. Basically you'll create new files and folders and either copy and paste the files in or download the images and upload your own.
