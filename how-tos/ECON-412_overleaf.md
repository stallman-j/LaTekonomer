# Should I Use Overleaf?

If you're interested in doing research projects in the future (like writing a senior thesis), I highly, highly recommend getting started with Overleaf. 

If you're not planning on writing a senior thesis and don't plan on doing research projects beyond this class, Microsoft Word or Markdown will do just fine.

In Microsoft Word, the `Alt+=` key combination will open up the equation editor. It takes a little getting used to in Word, but once you know the main key combinations it's very quick. You can reference almost all of what you'll need [here](https://mathiho.sitehost.iu.edu/doc/equation-editor-shortcut-commands.pdf). The syntax is *close* to what LaTex or Markdown use, but isn't always exactly the same.

There are a lot of ways you can extend the capabilities of Overleaf.

In particular, you can sync your Overleaf repository with Github. You can also download LaTex onto your machine and use local files. These are a lot more complicated to set up so we'll ignore them for now. You can check out the [LaTekonomer documentation](https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/how-tos/documentation-LaTekonomer/) if you're interested in those options.

# Feedback

If you're finding anything unclear or unhelpful, let me know in my [ECON 412 Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWYUyhNyq6OfDbsTyurtNOa1xjKZzi5CK36wMbdPHCRPVURQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

It's anonymous unless you want me to respond, in which case you need to tell me who you are.

# Getting Started 

Assuming the reason you're still here is that you're planning on using Overleaf, let's get started.

## Copy the ECON 412 Overleaf Template

1. You'll need an <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/" > Overleaf account </a>.

    Your Yale email will give you access to Overleaf premium, which would allow you to sync Overleaf directly to GitHub. 

    If you're unsure which email to use, just use your university email for now. 

    You can port all your stuff out in the future if you prefer using your personal account then.

2. Once you have your account, log into Overleaf.

3. Click on this <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/read/wsrdjdckwmbz#f4467b" > share link </a>. You won't be able to edit my Overleaf folders, but you'll be able to see it and copy it into your own Overleaf account. 

    If you're not logged into Overleaf, I don't think you can copy the project. It'll just ask if you want to download it.

    Click `Join Project`. If you don't see this join project page but you do see the page of Step 4 below, don't worry. You just want to get to where you can see the "Menu" option.

    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_01.png" alt="join overleaf project" width="80%" />
    <p class="caption">Join the ECON 412 Overleaf Project </p>
    </div> 


4. Click "Menu" on the top left of the screen with the project showing in Overleaf, and then "Copy Project"
    
    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_02.png" alt="menu button" width="80%" />
    <p class="caption">Menu</p>
    </div> 

    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_03.png" alt="copy overleaf project" width="30%" />
    <p class="caption">Copy the Overleaf Project</p>
    </div> 


5. Rename to something like "ECON-412_your-name". 

    You might not want to use just "ECON-412" the way the following figure shows.

    If you're using Overleaf for your own stuff, you'll most likely end up using one of your group member's Overleaf projects as your group project, and you don't want all your projects named the same thing.

    You'll all then be able to view and edit these files in real time. It's like Google Docs, but so much geekier.

    <div class="figure" align="center">
    <img src="https://stallman-j.github.io/LaTekonomer/figures/how-tos/ECON-412/overleaf_04.png" alt="rename and create" width="40%" />
    <p class="caption">Rename and Create</p>
    </div> 

6. This should bring you to your own project page. You'll be able to access this folder any time you access Overleaf. Click on the pdf `ECON-412_HW-01_guidance.pdf` in that project page for your next steps.

# Adding New Files

I'll add this for project assignment 1 once it's up. Basically you'll create new files and folders and either copy and paste the files in or download the images and upload your own.
