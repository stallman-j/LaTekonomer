"Den som är väldigt stark måste också vara väldigt snäll." - Astrid Lindgren

LaTekonomer aims to provide those Overleaf/LaTex templates that many economists wish someone else would make and maintain. 

The templates include but are not limited to: general math writing; homework write-ups; article write-ups with bibliographies; professional but simple dark and light Beamer templates; tables (including three-part tables with footnotes); figures; and a few research project assignments.

The research project assignments come from ECON 412 International Environmental Economics, a course taught at Yale University by Sam Kortum, for which Jillian Stallman has been teaching assistant in Fall 2023 and Fall 2024.

Many of these tables and figures are outputs of vignettes and code provided in the R package [**ekonomR**](https://github.com/stallman-j/ekonomR).  **ekonomR** and **LaTekonomer**  are designed to be complementary research templates, getting you moving forward on your project whether you're at the stage of tinkering with your final figure captions or figuring out what Overleaf even is. 

If you're starting a new project I highly recommend checking out **ekonomR**, but the use of **LaTekonomer** does not require **ekonomR** or vice versa.

I should note that LaTex isn't the only way to produce figures, tables, and commentary. Code doesn't work great with Word, but the obvious competitor to LaTex is Markdown. If you're interested in exploring the Markdown world, check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/book/), which integrates sublimely with R and GitHub. This README, for instance, is composed with Markdown.
