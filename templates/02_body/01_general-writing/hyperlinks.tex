\section{Cross-Referencing and Hyperlinks}\label{sec:hyperlinks}

For more on hyperlinks, note that you need the hyperref package, and then it looks something like this: for more see \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/hyperlinks}{this page}.

For more on cross-referencing as regards referring to your tables, see the discussion on cross-referencing in the \verb+basic_tables+ in section \ref{table_cross_referencing}.

I've added the package \verb+xurl+ to the preamble. This package was created in 2017 to allow URLs to break across lines (if you have a very long URL and want the entire think to be clickable as a hyperlink). See \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3033/forcing-linebreaks-in-url}.
