\section*{Problem 1}
 Suppose that the cost function for mitigation is $C=40A^2$ and that the benefits are given by $B=800A-10A^2$, where $A$ gives tons of mitigation. Assume every ton of pollution causes harm.

\begin{ex}
What level of mitigation minimizes total abatement costs?

\begin{sol}
  As the cost function is increasing everywhere there's positive mitigation, total abatement costs are only minimized when there's no abatement, i.e. $A=0$
\end{sol}
  \end{ex}
