\section{Tables with Stata}\label{stata_tables}

For general info on tables, refer to links and examples in \verb+basic-tables-template+ . This section goes over some of the examples of working from Stata to Latex.

For demos on using stata to excel and stata to Latex, see \href{https://github.com/worldbank/stata-tables}{The World Bank DIME's stata-table github.} Really, these folks are great.


\subsection{Exercise 1.b}
This gives an example of inputting a table from stata output (original source: Econ 551 pset 07, stata code in the relevant stata folder for that).

Table~\ref{tab:ps07q1bgmm} presents the  OLS regression of $y_i = \alpha +\tau d_i$ with VCE robust standard errors.
