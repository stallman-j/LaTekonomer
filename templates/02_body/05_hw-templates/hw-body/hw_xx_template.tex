I'd like to express my deep gratitude to Rachel Renne, Seung Min Kim, Weining Fang, and Yihong Wang for collaboration and support. 

My code assumes that you have installed the \verb+causalToolbox+ and \verb+rForestry+ and some other packages that are common.

\section{Problem 1 Transphobia 1}


\subsection{Pre-Processing}

    Given that door-to-door canvassing is not an area of expertise for me, I follow the authors' rationales as indicated in their supplementary materials to select outcome variables \citep[p.6-10]{broockmanSupplementaryMaterialsDurably2016}. The transphobia literature at this time lacked widely accepted measures to measure anti-transgender prejudice, so the authors constructed several indices in an attempt to measure negative attitudes more broadly. 
    
   
    
    Consider \verb+gender\_norm\_moral\_t\#+  I find the \verb+gender\_norm\_looks\_t\#+ to be an interesting question: 
    \begin{quote}
    To keep children from being confused, it's better when men look and act like men, and women look and act like women.    
    \end{quote} 
    
    
    \textbf{Covariates to Include:}
    
    The authors describe their preferred covariates in their Supplementary Materials, although I don't necessarily share their priors. They suggest that Democrats will be more responsive to treatment than Republicans:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb+vf\_racename+ (possibly different cultural experiences or personal experience with different gender expression, and variation in social desirability of certain views)
        \item \verb+vf\_party+ (may pick up differences in social desirability)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Preliminary Data Processing:}
    Figures~\ref{fig:hw-04_q-01a_data-skim_keepvars-01} and ~\ref{fig:hw-04_q-01a_data-skim_keepvars-02} present an initial look at the data with \verb+skim+. I have included additional outcomes for the purposes of missing data analysis, to which we now turn.
