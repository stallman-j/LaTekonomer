\section{Problem 1}


\subsection{Pre-Processing}

 
    \begin{quote}
    To keep children from being confused, it's better when men look and act like men, and women look and act like women.

\textbf{Covariates to Include:}
    
    The authors describe their preferred covariates in their Supplementary Materials, although I don't necessarily share their priors. They suggest that Democrats will be more responsive to treatment than Republicans:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb+vf\_racename+ (possibly different cultural experiences or personal experience with different gender expression, and variation in social desirability of certain views)
        \item \verb+vf\_party+ (may pick up differences in social desirability)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Preliminary Data Processing:}
    Figures~\ref{fig:hw-04_q-01a_data-skim_keepvars-01} and ~\ref{fig:hw-04_q-01a_data-skim_keepvars-02} present an initial look at the data with \verb+skim+. I have included additional outcomes for the purposes of missing data analysis, to which we now turn.
