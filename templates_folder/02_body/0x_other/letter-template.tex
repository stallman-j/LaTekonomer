% Letter body

I would like to recommend [insert name here]'s "[insert title here]" to be revised and resubmitted. The article presents an experiment undertaken in a critical juncture for Turkey, and yields intriguing results on potential channels of voter polarization. 

However, I'd like to express reservations regarding the precedent this style of research sets, as it borders on conflating the role of the researcher with that of a political activist.

% Closing statement
\closing{Sincerely yours,}

\end{letter}
